The Sx10 can not host any scripts or execute them. Another device is require to monitor and push these events on that system.


This panel was developed to provide better context to the user and help transisition them to a new SIP platform.

Our use case was for Webex and Zoom, but this tool can be modified to fit any SIP enabled Web conferencing service.

To keep tings short, this is more so a modified call button, that appends your Webex domain to the end of an address and apppends Zoom's sip dial pattern to the end of an adress.

Each section provides clear text on how to use each service.

It also shortens the time it takes to enter in meeting credentials.

This button has been live for about 2 months in our org, and has gotten very positive feedback.

Thanks,
