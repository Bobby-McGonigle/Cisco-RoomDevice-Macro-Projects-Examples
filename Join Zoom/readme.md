| Project | Description|
|:---|:---|
|JoinZoom| Zoom has a uniform SIP Uri, we can exploit this to make a simple, semi-automated entry point on the Touch 10, with User Rich context|
|Join Zoom with Security Enhancements| Well my first Join Zoom button has been thworted by manditroy passwords, using the Button above muddies the water a bit, so let's refine this process so that it still provides a rich experience, but allows us to capture a meeting password and host Key too |
|Join Zoom with Analytics|Go Check out Microsoft Power Automate!, because we're going to use it here! I've modified the original Join Zoom button to capture key information and Post it to a spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will analyze the data and let me know if my users are using the Join Zoom button, or the Call button|
