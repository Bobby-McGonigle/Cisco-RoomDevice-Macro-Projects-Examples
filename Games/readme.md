Collaboration is a great way to get people together and work to achieve an even greater goal. But not all collaborative efforts need to be grounded solely in work.

Getting your team to work together can have it's challenges, but I'm sure a puzzle or game of Tic Tac Toe could help clear the mind and get people to connect.

Collaborative technologies are great but it's nothing without the people who make them or the people who use them.

So let's get our users to collaborate and grow together
