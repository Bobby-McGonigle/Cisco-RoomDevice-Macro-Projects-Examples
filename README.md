# Macro-Samples
Cisco Video Endpoint Macro Repository by Robert McGonigle Jr

## Welcome!

* Thank you for stopping by!
* This Git is intended for those who tend to use Cisco Room Devices and their Macro Editor
* I tend to make these systems the center of most of my designs and rely very little on other services or hardware.
* This is partially due to a lack of resources and a lack of knowledge, but you can make these systems dance like never before with the Macro Editor and I want to push them to their limits (Oh my poor Dx80, I hope you continue to recover after each crash XD)

* Sorry for the lack of comments, sorry for the lack of finesse in my scripting. Still relatively new at this, but learning and succeeding everyday.
* I enjoy any and all feedback, as you all may see a simpler way to implement my code than I can, I just hope I can inspire those to dive deeper in Cisco Room systems as a great all around Telepresence and AV system and maybe save you a couple of $$ along the way :smiley:

## What I have so far

| Project | Description | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| [Launch Meeting](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/LaunchMeeting) | A Button that helps simplify the entry process for both Webex and Zoom (Prior to Join Webex Button) | 
| [Media Player](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Media%20Player)| Grabs the Digital Signage platform by the horns, and modifies it into a User Interactive media player for Room and Board series endpoints. Get in room Docs and Videos right on the Touch 10 |
| [T10 Command Center](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/T10%20Command%20Center) | Use 1 telepresence system to execute commands on any number of other room systems, Great for AV control rooms and Administrative Assistants |
|[Macro Memory Storage](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Macro%20Memory%20Storage)| A good way to store some information on the endpoint for safe keeping, and a good way to make use of every configuration item, even if you don't need it :)|
|[Join Zoom](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Join%20Zoom)| Several variations of an entry way for Dialing into SIP enabled Zoom sessions (Has since replaced my beloved LaunchMeeting)|
|[KeyBeam](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/RoomDevice-Macro-Samples/tree/master/KeyBeam)| The KeyBeam is an DIY Room Partition sensor that's low cost, makes use of the Macro Environment, plugs directly into a Room or Board Series Endpoint, and no Room Controller Needed! (for this sensor at least). Why call it KeyBeam, because it's a keyboard with a Beam Sensor! :smiley:|
| [Silenced Standby Mode](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Cisco-RoomDevice-Macro-Projects-Examples/tree/master/Silenced%20Standby%20Mode)| For those who just don't like Room Devices waking up too much when not in use, a simple solution to keep an endpoint asleep |
| [Ad-Hoc Conference](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Cisco-RoomDevice-Macro-Projects-Examples/tree/master/Ad-Hoc%20Conference) | A way for you to assign a Webex, Zoom, Bluejeans, Etc. account to a room device, without disclosing the information to users. Let's any user walk into a space and start conferencing, great for public spaces or students. |
|[Macro Snippets](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Cisco-RoomDevice-Macro-Projects-Examples/tree/master/Macro%20Snippets)| Small pieces of code, that can be included in a variety of scripts, such as a Network Health Checker and a BootStatus checker. Not a full tool, just pieces to add to and strengthen your own Macros.|

## Check out other **AWESOME!** Projects in the Github Community!

| Links | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
|[roomdevices-macros-samples](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/roomdevices-macros-samples)| A bunch of great examples to learn from, I can't thank this link enough for its content |
|[awesome-api](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-xapi)| Nearly a map of all thing Room devices, from macro sample, to server side management of endpoints |
|[CE-Deploy](https://github.com/voipnorm/CE-Deploy)| A fantastic deployment tool for the Macro editor, branding, software deployment, and the list is continuing to grow |

## Disclaimer

* These samples/projects are meant to help guide newcomers into the Macro realm, as well as inpire different possibilities with these endpoints. 
  * AKA, may include some bugs here an there.
* These scripts have been tested and worked well for me, so feel free to implement them, but the xApi can change, be mindful when deploying, always test first :smiley:

# Happy Coding XD
