# Macro-Samples
Cisco Video Endpoint Macro Repository by Robert McGonigle Jr

## Welcome!

* Thank you for stopping by!
* This Git is intended for those who tend to use Cisco Room Deivces and their Macro Editor
* I tend to make these systems the center of most of my designs and rely very little on other services or hardware.
* This is partially due to a lack of resources and a lack of knowledge, but you can make these systems dance like never before with the Macro Editor and I want to push them to their limits (Oh my poor Dx80, I hope you continue to recover after each crash XD)

* Sorry for the lack of comments, sorry for the lack of finesse in my scripting. Still relativley new at this, but learning and succeeding everyday.
* I enjoy any and all feedback, as you all may see a simpler way to implement my code than I can, I just hope I can inspire those to dive deeper in Cisco Room systems as a great all around Telepresence and AV system and maybe save you a couple of $$ along the way :)

## What I have so far

| Project | Description | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| [Crestron and Cisco](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Crestron%20and%20Cisco) | Some projects where Cisco Room devices act as the room controller, taking charge of certain Crestron hardware and elimitating complexity | 
| [Launch Meeting](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/LaunchMeeting) | A Button that helps simplify the entry process for both Webex and Zoom (Prior to Join Webex Button) | 
| [Media Player](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Media%20Player)| Grabs the Digital Signage platform by the horns, and modifies it into a User Interactable media player for Room and Board series endpoints. Get in room Docs and Videos right on the Touch 10 |
| [T10 Command Center](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/T10%20Command%20Center) | Use 1 telepresence system to execute commands on any number of other room systems, Great for AV control rooms and Administrative Assistants |
|[Macro Memory Storage](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Macro%20Memory%20Storage)| A good way to store some information on the endpoint for safe keeping, and a good way to make use of every configuration item, even if you son't need it :)|
|[Join Zoom](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Macro-Samples/tree/master/Join%20Zoom)| Several variations of an entry way for Dialing into SIP enabled Zoom sessions (Has since replaced my beloved LaunchMeeting)|
