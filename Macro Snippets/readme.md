# Macro Snippets

Bits and pieces to add to your designs

**NOTE**: These are not full projects, just piece of code that could be useful in your Macro development.
* Anything that may be worthwhile in a tool, that's compact, small and easy to re-work will find a home here.

## What I have so far

| Snippet | Description |
|:---|:---|
|[Network Health Check](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Cisco-RoomDevice-Macro-Projects-Examples/tree/master/Macro%20Snippets/Network%20Health%20Check)| This code block polls you IPv4 and looks for a change, if the IP found does not meet the IP expected, run xApi commands, configs, etc. |
|[Boot Status Checker](https://github.com/Bobby-McGonigle/Cisco-RoomDevice-Macro-Projects-Examples/tree/master/Macro%20Snippets/Boot%20Status%20Checker)| Sometimes the Macro Environment could crash. sometimes the Room Device could restart. This script can help you determine which is which, so you can run the xApi the way you need too.|

# Happy Coding XD
